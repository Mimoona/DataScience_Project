# StartUps_Investment

## Final project of course 'data science' at ReDI School of Munich.

* Problem statement: can we predict whether a startup will succeed?

I analyzed dataset and explored trends and insights using past data for previously founded startups to identify initial factors and influences that can help new startups to succeed. I narrowed the term "success" to getting acquired and operating in this scenario and "failure" as closing.
My target variable is 'status' that has 3 labels: acquired, Operating, closed. I observed the following features:

1. Market
2. Country
3. Total Funding
4. Seed Fund
5. Funding Time Span
6. Number of Rounds

For modeling, I applied classification algorithm, Logistic Regression. I also applied ANN(Artificial Neural Network).

### Tools
